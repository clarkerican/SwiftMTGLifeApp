Because my first Android app was a Life Counter, I though it only fitting that I also made an iOS life Counter (albeit with less functionality).  

This application is meant for me to experiment with and get a better grasp on the framework.  

I got some experience with Steppers and learned that unlike some things, the Controller does not need to implement their delegate for them to function correctly.  There simply needs to be an event listener. I also learned they can all be hooked to the same event listener. (Probably the most important take-away).
